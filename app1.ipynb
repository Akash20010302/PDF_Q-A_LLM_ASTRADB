Introduction  \\nPublished measures of growth in productivity and real gross domestic product (GDP) since the early \\n2000s have been distressingly slow despite very visible improvements in high -tech equipment (the smart \\nphone), in internet -based services (Facebook and Google), in business models (Uber and Lyft), and in the \\nquality of health care. This has revived interest in h ow well official measures capture improvements in \\nstandards of living (see, for example, Feldstein, 2017). Part of the literature that considers the \\nexplanations for recently weak productivity growth explicitly explores measurement issues. Much of this \\nwork concludes that measurement is at best a small part of the explanation for slower trend productivity \\ngrowth (Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf, 2016, Syverson, 2016, and Fernald, Hall, Stock, and Watson, \\n2017) but a few argue that measurement has played a lar ger role (Varian, 2016, and Hatzius, 2017.) . \\nConcerns about measurement are, of course, not at all new to experts on economic statistics, \\nincluding those in government and in academia. For decades, data -producing agencies have been working \\nto improve measu rement and to make sure that standards are consistent across countries. These efforts \\nhave yielded major methodological advances. Moulton (2018), for example, catalogs key improvements to \\nthe U.S. national income and product accounts since the late 1990s.  \\nMore people are now entering the discussion and more economists are looking to do research that can \\nhelp support the statistical agencies. The starting point for these efforts should be a basic understanding \\nof how the statistics are defined and how they are limited, both in terms of the concept and in terms of \\nhow they are calculated given the concept. While much of this information can be found in writings by \\nexperts on economic statistics, this literature is large in volume and often hard to understand by non -\\nexperts, even other economists. The goal of this paper is to supply some basic answers, with a focus on \\nreal GDP, the most closely -watched aggregate economic indicator and one which is so often used as a \\nmeasure of the standard of living. Accurately  measuring real GDP is essential to accurately measuring \\nproductivity, which is essentially output (real GDP) divided by inputs.  \\nWe begin our paper with a discussion of how the established GDP concept relates to welfare, or more \\nspecifically to a somewhat narrower concept that we term “aggregate economic well -being” which \\nexcludes factors that are very far outside the scope of GDP, such as the quality of the environment. We \\nexplain the advantages to GDP as defined and consider the importance of the differen ces between GDP \\nand economic well -being. We also discuss some alternative and complementary approaches that can help \\nbridge the gap between GDP and economic well -being.  \\nWe next turn to how well GDP as conceptualized by data producers is captured in practi ce. \\nNotwithstanding the important advances in measurement over time, increases in the share of GDP \\nrepresented by difficult -to-measure sectors (such as health care and the digital economy) may mean that \\nthe published GDP figures do not track the conceptual  ideal as well as they have done in the past. \\nMoreover, the limited resources of data -producing agencies (which are at risk of future cuts in the current \\npolitical environment) may constrain these agencies’ ability to cope with such challenges.  \\nWe consider  first whether the nominal (i.e. current dollar) GDP figure adequately captures the size of \\nour economy measured in dollars. We conclude that mostly it does, but there are two important \\nmeasurement challenges. One challenge is the treatment of so -called “f ree goods,” particularly given the \\ndramatic rise in services provided by the internet for which consumers do not explicitly pay. Another is \\nthe understatement of the domestic economic activity of multinational enterprises that arises from tax \\nincentives.  '),\n",

Hence, the second (and much larger) part of our measurement \\ndiscussion concerns challenges related to the deflat ors used to calculate real GDP. A central issue here is \\nhow to separate changes in prices that reflect quality improvements from those that represent true \\ninflation. Another issue is estimating the value of dollars spent on newly introduced goods and servi ces. \\nThe paper offers a discussion of the ideal way to treat these measurement issues and then discusses what \\nthe stat istical agencies do in practice.  \\nWe draw several conclusions. First, GDP, as currently defined, should retain its stature as a major \\necono mic statistic. While it is not a comprehensive measure of welfare or even economic well -being, the \\nGDP concept —along with the pieces of GDP available through the national accounts —is useful in and of \\nitself and should provide a great deal of information th at is closely related to welfare. Second, there is \\nscope for materially improving specific parts of the GDP calculation to be more closely aligned with the \\nconceptual ideal. Doing so should be a goal for the statistical community and for the broader commun ity \\nof economists. Third, given the limitations of GDP as a measure of welfare (and the potential for those \\nlimitations to increase over time), we should continue to develop complementary measures or sets of \\nmeasures (sometimes termed “dashboards”) that mo re completely capture well -being.  \\n2.  The GDP concept  \\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) gives a clear definition for GDP:  \\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation’s \\neconomy less the value of the goods a nd services used up in production. GDP is also equal to the \\nsum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of \\ngoods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment.1 \\nThe U.S. Commerce Dep artment began to publish regular estimates of GDP, defined essentially as \\nabove, in the early 1940s (Carson, 1975). The Commerce Department framework built on methods that \\nSimon Kuznets used to estimate national income for 1929 -32 under the auspices of the  National Bureau of \\nEconomic Research (NBER). Kuznets’s work was preceded by two volumes published by the NBER in the \\nearly 1920s that provided estimates of national income over the preceding decade. Others were also \\nengaged in efforts to measure economic activity around this time. For example, the National Industrial \\nConference Board (which later became just the Conference Board) began publishing a regular estimate of \\nnational income in the 1920s. Colin Clark, a British economist and statistician, was doin g work similar to \\nKuznets’s, measuring the aggregate economy of the United Kingdom (Coyle, 2014).  \\nGDP is the featured measure of output in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), a vast \\nset of economic data that captures economic activity in the  United States.2 Some explanation of the NIPAs \\n. . . \\n1. See www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm.  \\n2. The NIPAs are, in turn, just one part of a broader set of U.S. national accounts th at also include the Labor Department’s \\nproductivity statistics and the Federal Reserve’s system of financial accounts. Dale Jorgenson, who has made enormous \\ncontributions over his career to a wide array of national accounting practices both in this country  and in other countries, \\ndescribes the national accounts “as a kind of central nervous system for federal statistics” (Jorgenson, 2010).

As described in Bureau of Economic Analysis (2015), there \\nare different approaches to measuring GDP. The “expenditure approach,” in which GDP is measured as \\nthe s um of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports, is the most familiar to many \\npeople. The expenditure side of the national accounts includes estimates of these pieces as well as their \\ncomponents. GDP can also be measured through the “in come approach,” which adds up all of the income \\nearned through production, and the income side of the national accounts includes the various types of \\nincome that goes into GDP. The income -side measure of GDP is known as Gross Domestic Income (GDI). \\nIn theo ry, GDP measured through the expenditure approach should equal GDI; in practice, of course, \\nGDP does not equal GDI because of measurement error, and BEA publishes a “statistical discrepancy” \\nthat captures the gap between the two series.3 \\n2.1  The differenc es between GDP and w elfare  \\nAs a long literature has emphasized, GDP as conventionally defined differs in many ways from welfare.4 \\nThe economists who developed the modern concept of GDP were well aware of this distinction. For \\nexample, in a 1934 report to Congress, Kuznets stated that “the welfare of a nation … can scarcely be \\ninferred from a measure of national income” (Bureau of Fo reign and Domestic Commerce and Kuznets, \\n1934).  \\nSome of the differences between GDP and welfare are outside the scope of this paper. For example, \\nGDP does not include important societal features such as discrimination and crime. In addition, as an \\neconomy -wide concept, GDP does not provide information about the distribution of income, which bears \\nimportantly on the welfare of individuals within an economy.5 Nor does GDP capture features of the \\nenvironment such as climate change and the availability of natur al resources.  \\nMuch of the discussion of GDP and welfare in this paper will focus on a narrower distinction —the \\ndifference between GDP and what we call aggregate  economic  well -being , defined as the consumer \\nwelfare derived from market -based activities and selected non -market -based activities such as services \\nprovided by governments, certain nonprofit institutions, and homeownership.  \\n \\nThe key differences between GDP and aggregate eco nomic well -being are:  \\n \\n1. GDP excludes most home production, and other “non -market” activities such as leisure , even \\nthough most such activity effectively increases the true consumption of households and thus \\nenhances welfare (more discussion of this point be low).  \\n. . . \\n3. There is also a “ value -added approach ” to measuring GDP  which involves taking the difference between total sales and th e \\nvalue of intermediate inputs or summing up the “value added” at each stage of the production process. This approach is centra l \\nto analyzing the economy at the industry level, but it does not figure prominently in the discussion that follows.   \\n4. Coyle (201 4) summarizes the historical debate over this issue. Jorgenson (forthcoming) provides an extensive discussion of \\nthe relationship between measured GDP and welfare. See also Constanza, Hart, Posner, and Talberth (2009 ), Wesselink, \\nBakkes, Best, Hinterb erger , and ten Brink (2007),  Kassenboehmer and Schmidt (2011), and Boyd (2007)  for more on this topic \\nand alternative measures of economic progress . \\n5.

GDP represents domestic production, but some of that production is “owned” by foreigners; \\nfurthermore, Americans own some foreign production . The welfare of Americans is more \\nclosely correlated with the income they receive from the production they ow n regardless of \\nwhere it occurs than simply the production done in this country.  \\n3. GDP includes production that makes up for the depreciation of physical assets . Such \\nproduction is done to maintain the current capital stock rather than increasing the service s \\nconsumed by households.   \\n4. GDP includes investment —by businesses, by government, and by households (through \\nhousing and consumer durables). While this investment may provide future services to \\nhouseholds, it does not represent services enjoyed immediately by households. We note, \\nthough, that there is some disagreement as to whether investment should be counted in a \\nmeasure of well -being. For example, Corrado, Fox, Goodridge, Haskel, Jona -Lasinio, Sichel, \\nand Westlake (2017) point out that one might view wel l-being as depending not only on \\ncurrent consumption but also on future consumption, which, in turn, is influenced by what \\nfirms are investing today.6  \\n \\nDespite these well -known differences, GDP is often used —by politicians, reporters, the general public, \\nand even economists —as a proxy for welfare or at least economic well -being. This begs the question of \\nwhy the economists and statisticians who developed the modern concept of GDP chose the definition they \\ndid. Our reading of the literature suggests several  factors contributed to their thinking.  \\nOne factor is that the modern market -production -based concept of GDP is better aligned with the \\nKeynesian concept of “demand.” Although new homes might yield services for consumers that raise \\nwelfare by modest increm ents over a long period of time, the investment associated with the building of \\nthose homes or cars use a lot of the economy’s productive resources over a short period of time. \\nPolicymakers who are trying to use fiscal or monetary tools to stabilize the ec onomy in the face of \\nbusiness -cycle fluctuations need to know how the use of productive resources compares to the economy’s \\nsupply of such resources.  \\nA second factor might be war -related. In particular, some have argued that it is no coincidence that \\nthe modern interest in measuring the aggregate economy arose during World War I and that needs \\nrelated to the war contributed to the production focus of the modern GDP concept. On the practical side, \\nunderstanding what the economy could produce presumably grea tly facilitated planning for war efforts \\n(Landefeld, 2000). Coyle (2014) also notes the political advantages of a production focus —production -\\nbased measures do not show the economy shrinking during wartime even if resources available for private \\nconsumptio n plummet.  \\nA third factor is feasibility. In particular, the literature suggests that home production and many other \\nactivities that are not captured by market transactions were left out because they were viewed as difficult \\nto measure. Indeed, there was a vigorous debate about whether it made sense, for example, that the \\nservices provided by professional and paid housekeepers were included in the GDP concept but that any \\npersonal housekeeping efforts were not included. It was accepted, though, that the la tter was more \\ndifficult to measure, and, as Carson (1975) describes, the economists involved in the NBER effort \\n. . . \\n6. This view echoes longer discussions in in Weitzman (1976) and Weitzman (2003), which argue  that net investment belongs in \\na welfare measure because it captures future consumption opportunities.

Similarly, trying to put a \\nvalue on leisure can be quite difficult , particularly given that individuals sometimes freely choose to take \\nleisure but at other times cannot work as many hours as they would like at the prevailing wage, and \\nsometimes may not be able to find work at all.  \\nRegarding this third factor, several a dditional points are worth noting. First, the precise boundary \\nbetween market production and non -market production has never been well defined. For example, the \\ncurrent methodological framework for GDP is not conceptually consistent. Services provided by c onsumer \\ndurable goods (like a car) are not included in GDP because they are viewed as non -market production, but \\nservices provided by owner -occupied homes are included through imputed rent (with the rent included on \\nboth the product and income sides of the  account so that the two sides will be aligned). Second, while it \\nmay have been extremely difficult to measure non -market production at the time the accounts were \\noriginally constructed, new technologies and data sources may offer opportunities to capture components \\nof economic well -being that previously were difficult or impossible to measure. Third, the cost of \\nexcluding traditionally defined non -market services may be greater than in the past, given that many of \\nthe services that people enjoy from the in ternet are not “paid for” through traditional market transactions. \\nWe return to this issue in our section on “free goods” below.  \\n2.2  Do these conceptual differences m atter?  \\nAny assessment of the GDP concept as a measure of aggregate economic well -being n eeds to recognize \\nthat many of the shortcomings are addressed by looking at measures that are already available as part of \\nthe standard national income accounts. For example, investment (including that making up for \\ndepreciation of assets) can be netted ou t of GDP. To address the issue that some of the income associated \\nwith domestic production belongs to foreigners (and, likewise, that Americans receive some income from \\nproduction that is done in other countries), gross national product (GNP), which captur es the production \\nof assets owned by Americans regardless of where in the world it occurs.7 \\nIndeed, one might expect consumption —derived from standard national accounts series and broadly \\ndefined to include both the spending done directly by households and  the services provided to households \\nby government spending —to align fairly well with economic well -being. (Note that consumption defined \\nin this way overcomes both shortcomings discussed in the previous paragraph: it excludes investment and \\nis funded by i ncome earned by Americans rather than income related to domestic consumption.) The \\nsolid black line in Figure 1 shows cumulative growth in real broadly defined consumption (the sum of \\npersonal consumption expenditures plus government consumption expenditur es) since 1970.8 The series \\nhas risen by roughly three -and-one-half fold over the 48 -year period shown. The figure also shows that \\ncumulative growth in real GDP (depicted by the red dashed line) has been about the same over this \\nperiod —suggesting that GDP,  even with its conceptual differences, is not a bad proxy for broadly defined \\nconsumption.  \\n. . . \\n7. BEA treated GNP as the primary measure of U.S. economic activity for many decades but switched its focus in 1991 to \\nconform with practices of statistical agencies in other countries.  \\n8. For this exercise, we ignore the fact that con sumption expenditure includes some durable goods, which yield consumption \\nservices (i.e. provide utility to the household) over time. Looking at only nondurables and services would not materially cha nge \\nour conclusion.  '),\n",

Trends in the importance of non -market \\nactivities could lead to a widening gap between household welfare and GDP such that changes  in \\nmeasured GDP may not proxy for changes in well -being over the longer run. For example, the surge of \\nwomen into the labor force in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s would have boosted GDP even if newly \\nemployed women were previously producing the same amount outside of the marketplace —a case in \\nwhich the increase in GDP would have overstated the increase in welfare. However, some more recent \\ntrends would go in the opposite direction. For example, the internet has made it easier for people to \\narrange for travel  directly instead of going through a travel agent —these personal efforts to book travel are \\nnot counted in GDP but the services of a travel agent would be counted, leading GDP growth to understate \\nthe increase in welfare. (In this case, at least the travel  purchased shows up in GDP —in our section on \\n“free goods” we discuss the degree to which services consumed more broadly via the internet are showing \\nup in GDP.)9 \\nBEA does periodically publish satellite accounts with values for some types of non -market acti vities. \\nRecent updates to these accounts (Bridgman, Dugan, Lal, Osborne, and Villones, 2012, and Bridgeman, \\n2016) include estimates for home production (such as cooking, cleaning, and shopping) and the services \\nprovided to households from durable goods (su ch as cars and appliances).

On a shorter -term basis, the two measures may deviate materially, as can be seen by \\nlooking at quarter -to-quarter growth rates. Figure 2 shows these growth rates. GDP is generally more \\nvolatile than consumption.

The underlying \\nargument echoes the discussion about the initial desig ners of GDP preferring a production -based concept \\nin part because it better aligned with the Keynesian notion of aggregate demand. In particular, an \\nimportant indicator of the health of an economy is whether economic resources are being fully utilized.

(As \\nCorrado, Fox, Goodridge, Haskel, Jona -Lasinio, Sichel, and Westlake, 2017, note, GDP effectively weight s \\nthe units produced of different goods and services by their prices, which should correspond to the values \\nof these items.) Of course, a single measure is not absolutely necessary —some proposals, such as the \\nOECD’s Better Life in itiative , merely call for a “dashboard” of factors related to welfare. The strength of \\ndashboards is that they allow users to apply their own weights; however, this is also a weakness when it \\ncomes to trying to reach consensus abo ut how different countries compare or how much welfare has \\nincreased over time.  \\nJones and Klenow (2016) (and Bernanke and Olson, 2017) took one concrete step toward creating a \\nbroader measure of welfare that draws from economic theory to weight different factors. The authors use \\na “consumption -equivalent” welfare approach combining data on consumption, leisure, inequality, and \\nmortality into a single summary statistic using an expected utility calculation that applies equal weight to \\neach person. They go o n to explore differences over time and across countries between this summary \\nstatistic and GDP, finding, for example, that their alternative statistic implies that living standards in \\nWestern European countries appear much closer to those in the United Sta tes because of longer life \\nspans, greater consumption of leisure, and lower inequality.  \\nAn entirely different approach to capturing welfare would be to simply ask people how happy they are. \\nWolfers (2003), Stevenson and Wolfers (2008), and Sack, Stevenson and Wolfers (2012), for instance, \\nexplore measures of so -called “subjective well -being.” Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) provide a thorough \\nanalysis of subjective well -being over time and across countries and conclude that such measures are \\nfairly well correl ated with absolute real income per capita (with some role for relative income). While \\nthere is some worry about the biases people exhibit when answering questions about their well -being (see \\nKrueger, 2008) and uncertainties about how to aggregate responses  to questions about happiness (Bond \\nand Lang, 2018), these measures are potentially important complements to indicators of well -being based \\non hard data.  \\n2.5  Summary  \\nWe have highlighted some important conceptual differences between GDP and aggregate econo mic well -\\nbeing (which itself is much narrower than overall welfare). However, series that are already included in \\nthe standard national income accounts can be used to construct a measure that, on a conceptual basis, \\nshould be correlated with the bulk of th e goods and services that determine economic well -being. \\nMoreover, we show that such a measure —combined private and public consumption —is well correlated \\n. . . \\n10.

However, even if this issue were important, it does not necessarily follow that the definition of \\nGDP should be changed; rather, it suggests th at we need to develop good alternative measures to \\nsupplement it. Retaining the current definition of GDP has the very significant advantage of keeping GDP \\ncomparable across time and across countries.  \\nThe discussion in this section has all concerned GDP as conceptualized . We now turn to the degree to \\nwhich actual GDP reflects economic well -being, which depends heavily on how well GDP is measured in \\npractice.  \\n3. Issues r elated to measuring n ominal GDP  \\nGiven our focus on economic well -being, we are ultimatel y interested in how well the official statistics \\nmeasure real GDP —that is, GDP that abstracts from the effects of price inflation. The real GDP concept is, \\nfor the most part, estimated by collecting data in current dollars to produce the components of “nom inal \\nGDP” and then adjusting these components to remove price inflation, thereby leaving just the “real” \\nactivity in the economy. Real GDP measurement problems can thus arise from either errors in the \\nestimation of nominal GDP or errors in the way that pri ce adjustment (or “deflation”) is done. In this \\nsection, we describe two major challenges in measuring nominal  GDP.  \\n3.1  “Free”  goods  \\nA recent source of discussion and debate is whether and how GDP should account for the vast amount of \\ninformation, entert ainment, and services that consumers obtain through the internet  seemingly for free. \\nThis problem is not new —households have consumed entertainment and news services via television, for \\nexample, for many decades without paying directly for it. But, with internet -provided services an ever -\\ngrowing part of our regular lives, there are increasing questions about the degree to which these services \\nare already accounted for in GDP and whether they should be counted in GDP.11 \\nBefore delving into the national acco unting issues surrounding free goods, it is useful to think very \\ngenerally about how these transactions work. The development and maintenance of internet -provided \\n“free” services is often funded by an interest in selling something, whether it be a traditio nal good or \\nservice (think shoes) or a premium product offered by the internet company supplying the service (think \\nSpotify Premium). In the case of shoes, for example, the shoemaker pays dollars to advertising companies \\nto create ads and pays dollars to i nternet companies (like Facebook) to place those ads, often targeting the \\nads using data that the internet company has collected from individual users. The internet company uses \\nthese dollars to develop content that induces individual users to look at ads and to give over their data. \\nMeanwhile, individual users consume the content, are influenced by the ads, and ultimately use some of \\ntheir earnings to purchase shoes.  \\n. . . \\n11. The statistical community is engaging in significant discussion of this particular issue and other implications of the \\n“digitalization” of the economy. For example, the IMF held a two -day forum in November 2017 on “ Measuring the Digital \\nEconomy ” and the OECD has done extensive work on measuring the digital economy (see, for example, Ahmad and Schreyer, \\n2016); likewise, the Fifth World KLEMS Conference , held in June 2018, dedicated a plenary session to the issue.

The dollars spent on shoes show up in nominal consumption (the \\n“expenditure side” of GDP). The wages and salaries of the workers at the shoe company, their suppliers, \\nand the internet company all show up in nominal national income (the “income side” of GDP), as do the \\nprofits of all of these companies. The key question, though, is whether these items are the only parts of the \\nbroader transaction described above that should be counted as part of nominal GDP.  \\nThe tradi tional national accounts approach views marketing broadly defined (including ads, \\npromotional merchandise, and anything else that comes along with the ads such as internet content) as an \\nintermediate input to the final good being promoted. This approach is  applied, for example, in the context \\nof “free” network television that is supported by advertisements. It means that the marketing does not \\nindependently contribute to GDP; it is captured in nominal GDP as long as we are capturing all of the \\ndollars that consumers spend on the final good.  \\nFigure 3 shows how the national accounting would work for the example above under the traditional \\napproach. The economy is viewed as just producing shoes, and, as described above, the dollars that \\nconsumers pay for shoes  show up on the expenditure side of nominal GDP and the dollars that that all \\nworkers earn and owners make show up on the income side of nominal GDP. The dollar amount is the \\nsame on both sides of the accounts so the two sides match (as should be the case with GDP accounting).  \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.  \\n \\nHowever, as noted in the box on the right side of Figure 3, there are parts of the transaction that are \\nnot counted under this approach. In particular, the approach would not count any independent value that \\nthe marketi ng broadly defined (including the internet -provided information, entertainment, and services) \\nprovides to the consumer. For many people these days, such items have become a regular part of their \\nlives in highly important ways —they allow people to get home faster, keep up with friends, do their taxes, \\nmeet potential romantic partners, manage their finances, cook better, find information at blistering \\nspeeds relative to the past, and consume a rich offering of video and audio entertainment. The approach \\nalso does not include anything (besides the dollars spent on shoes) that the consumer is giving up to \\nconsume this marketing —more specifically, the time they spend viewing ads and the data that they \\nprovide that allows for better targeting of ads.  \\n'),\n",

Under this approach, consumers are engaging in a transaction where they exchange \\ntheir time spent viewing ads and data for the “free” internet content they consume. This transaction is \\nvery much a market transaction, albeit not a monetary transaction. But the absence of money in the \\ntransaction has not stopped statistical agencies from including other non -monetary transactions in GDP \\nsuch as the “free” services that are provided by banks to account holders and the rent al value of owner -\\noccupied housing, both of which are imputed and then included as part of consumption.  \\nFigure 4 shows how this alternative approach would work in the national accounts. In this case, both \\nshoes and internet content supported by marketing a re final goods. The value of the time spent viewing \\nads and the data that the consumer give up by consuming the internet content are akin to the dollars that \\nthey pay to consume shoes on the expenditure side of the GDP accounts. The internet content repres ents \\nwhat they are “paid” for viewing ads and providing data, much like the earnings they receive for doing \\ntraditional work.  \\n \\nFigure 4.  \\n \\nAs noted in the box, including these additional market (but non -monetary) transactions would raise \\nnominal GDP, whet her measured as expenditures or as income, while still leaving the expenditure and \\nincome sides of the accounts matching.  \\nWhat would still not be counted in nominal GDP under the alternative approach would be internet \\ncontent that is not created as part o f an effort to promote a product —such as cat videos created as \\nsomeone’s hobby. One might view these services as largely home production or leisure, being arguably \\nsimilar to the value provided to friends when one visits them. As a result, it would be appr opriate not to \\ninclude them in a GDP measure that excludes home production.  \\nThus far, our discussion has focused on the right way to capture “free” goods in nominal GDP in \\nprinciple —doing so in practice  raises a number of challenges, as does translating t he imputed dollars \\n. . . \\n12.

While the former may be fairly straightforward to \\nmeasure, measuring the latter is more difficult —the authors attempt to identify the costs associated with \\ntraditional in -house marketing activity at internet companies, but arguably some or a ll of the costs of \\nsoftware and application development should be included.  \\nTranslating nominal GDP for this category into real GDP is also complicated. In the absence of market \\ntransactions, the value could be ascertained by finding similar services that do have market prices, \\nrecognizing, of course, that the final good in these cases is the content, not the advertising. For example, \\none could use a deflator for entertainment in the case of videos or software in the case of free applications.  \\nAlternativel y, statistical agencies could measure real GDP in this area directly —by asking people \\ndirectly about willingness to pay for free goods and services, as suggested by Corrado, Fox, Goodridge, \\nHaskel, Jona -Lasinio, Sichel, and Westlake (2017). This approach h as the potential to get around many of \\nthe challenges just described. Brynjolfsson, Eggers, and Gannamaneni (2017) sample very large numbers \\nof people online about what compensation they would require to forgo use of a digital service like \\nFacebook or emai l. They find that consumers would require significant compensation to give up a variety \\nof free digital goods, in particular goods that are essential to many professions —the median willingness to \\naccept to give up a service for a year is $17,530 for Search  Engines, $8,414 for email, and $3,648 for \\ndigital maps. Brynjolfsson, Diewert, Eggers, Fox and Gannamaneni (2018) propose a new metric, “GDP -\\nB,” that would use results like these to augment GDP by the value of new goods and free goods; they find \\nthat a GD P-B statistic that includes just the value of Facebook would have grown measurably faster than \\npublished GDP between 2004 and 2017. This research not only refutes the view that accounting for “free” \\ngoods is simply unfeasible but also underscores the urgen cy for serious consideration of these issues.  \\nGiven that the consumption of “free” goods appears to be growing, more accurately capturing this \\nconsumption would lead to larger GDP and faster GDP growth than officially reported. The changes would \\npartly flo w through to productivity as well (though not entirely, given that consumers’ “work” viewing ads \\nand giving up data should, at least in principle, raise inputs as well).  \\n3.2  Understatement of the domestic economic activity of multinational e nterprises  \\nAs discussed by Varian (2016) and Guvenen, Mataloni, Rassier, and Ruhl (2017), the rise of global supply \\nchains and the legal latitude that companies have in declaring in which countries their economic activity \\ntakes place lend material downward bias to estim ates of U.S. nominal GDP. In particular, “transfer \\npricing” and other practices allow multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in the United States to \\nunderprice the sale or lease of intangible assets —such as blueprints, software, or new drug formulas —to \\naffiliates in low -tax jurisdictions so that more of their profits  are booked in these countries.  \\nThe economic importance of such transactions has been documented in a variety of ways. For \\ninstance, in 2012, a Senate subcommittee questioned Microsoft about  its agreements to shift some R&D \\ncosts and regional royalty rights to affiliates in Singapore and Ireland (U.S. Congress Senate Committee \\non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, 2012). In 2013, the subcommittee found that Apple \\n. . . \\n13. This does not need to be done separately for both the expenditure and income sides of the accounts; the two parts of the \\nexchange should be equivalent so the calculation can be done just once and t hen added to both sides. The national accounts \\ntake this approach with the services arising from owner -occupied housing (with the homeowner viewed as both the consumer \\nand the producer).  '),\n",

More \\ngenerally, Hines (2005) and Lipsey (2006) show that U.S. MNEs regist er more profits in tax havens than \\ncan plausibly be accounted for by economic activity. Jenniges, Mataloni, Stutzman, and Xin (2018) find \\nthat U.S. companies that have a cost sharing agreement with a foreign entity appear less productive than \\nsimilar compa nies without such an agreement, and foreign companies that have a cost sharing agreement \\nwith a parent company in the U.S. appear more productive than similar foreign companies. A 2016 OECD \\nbrief  described how such transactions drove a 26 percent increase in measured GDP in Ireland in 2015. \\nAnd, Tørsløv, Wier, and Zucman (2018) estimated that nearly 40 percent of multinational profits are \\nshifted to low -tax countries each year.  \\nUnde r current methods, transfer pricing and profit shifting have led to an understatement of both \\nnominal GDP and nominal gross domestic income (GDI). Consider the example of a smartphone whose \\nsoftware, blueprints, and branding are developed in the United Sta tes. If the phone is assembled in the \\nUnited States, then the full value of the phone (priced at its market price) is included in GDP. If the phone \\nis assembled abroad, then so long as the contract between the company doing the assembly (e.g. Foxconn) \\nis an arm’s length transaction, GDP will still be correctly measured, as it will include the value of the \\nphone less the amount paid to the foreign assembler.  \\nHowever, if a foreign -affiliate of the U.S. company is introduced in the transaction, GDP could end up \\nunderstated. Here’s one way this could happen: the U.S. company leases the rights to the intangible \\ncapital —the software, blueprints, and branding —to an affiliate in a low -tax country (say, Ireland) and it \\nprices that lease at a value that is much less than its market value. Then the Irish affiliate  contracts with \\nFoxconn to do the assembly. Phones are then exported from Ireland to the United States and from Ireland \\nto the rest of the world. In this case, only the value of the lease from the U.S. company  to the Irish \\ncompany will be included in U.S. GDP, and if this lease is priced at an artificially low level, U.S. GDP will \\nbe too low as well.  \\nUnder current methods, estimates of imports associated with sales of the phone in the United States \\nwill be too  high because the economic activity associated with the leased assets is unlikely to be attributed \\nto this country.14 In particular, imports will be too high (because they will overstate the Irish content of \\nthe phone imported from Ireland), and exports wil l be too low (because they will understate the U.S. \\ncontent of phones exported from Ireland to the rest of the world). The same bias would occur in GDI \\nbecause of the understatement of the company’s U.S. earnings. Note that this transaction works because \\nthere is intangible capital that is hard to value and hard to pin to a location, and because the Irish \\ncompany is an affiliate of the U.S. company, so that it does not matter to shareholders whether the Irish \\naffiliate or the U.S. headquarters books the pro fits.  \\nThis problem is of increasing concern both because of the evidence discussed above regarding the \\nimportance of profit -shifting in today’s economy and, more generally, because of the growth in MNE \\nactivity in recent decades.15 MNEs are now a large par t of the global economy —according to Guvenon et \\n. . . \\n14. Imports are estimated using customs data, not tax data, so it would b e possible for a company to report numbers that are \\ninconsistent with their tax data (but a better representation of where the economic activity occurred). However, it seems \\nunlikely that the company would do so.  \\n15. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 sharply lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate, which should reduce the incentives for profit -\\nshifting, but also lowered taxes on the foreign income of U.S. corporations, which should increase it. The net effect is likely a \\nreduction in profit shifting (and an increa se in measured GDP), but the magnitude of the effect is unclear . See  Harris and \\nLooney (2018) for further details.

(2017), they accounted for $4.7 trillion of global value -added in 2017, an amount that was about the \\nsize of the fourth largest economy in the world at the time.16 The statistical community recognizes the \\nissue, and the international statistical guidelines most recently adopted by the United Nations Statistical \\nCommission (System of National Accounts 2008) called for estimates of the production activity of MNEs \\nto reflect the economic ownership of intangibl e assets rather than the legal ownership (Moulton, van de \\nVen 2018). There are practical challenges associated with how to do so, and the BEA has yet to change its \\nofficial methods to follow this guideline.  \\nGuvenon et al. (2017) explore one way in which th e guidelines might be at least partially \\nimplemented. The authors use confidential MNE survey data collected by the Bureau of Economic \\nAnalysis and reapportion the earnings of U.S. MNE foreign affiliates based on labor compensation and \\nsales to unaffiliate d parties. The authors’ findings suggest that current practices have materially distorted \\nestimated productivity growth at some points in the past —with an average annual understatement of \\ngrowth of 0.1 percentage point from 1994 through 2004 and 0.25 perce ntage point from 2004 through \\n2008 (though no effect between 2008 and 2014). These figures represent a lower bound on the distortion, \\nas foreign MNEs are probably also shifting some of their profits out of United States.17 Using this method, \\nBruner, Rassier , and Ruhl (2018) find that accounting for profit sharing would increase the level of U.S. \\nmeasured GDP by 1.5 percent in 2014.18 \\n4.  Translating nominal GDP into r eal GDP  \\nThe most complex set of issues relates to how nominal GDP is translated into real GDP . Measuring price \\nchanges correctly is central to this process. As we will explain, changes in production processes and the \\nbroader economy over time introduce significant challenges. Assessing the best way to proceed requires a \\nclear understanding of the different ways to measure the price changes, with a particular focus on how to \\n“correct” changes in observed prices for quality improvements.  \\n. . . \\n16. The growth in MNE activity has coincided with growth of “ factoryless goods producers”  (FGPs) in the United States —which \\ndevelop the intellect ual property, manage the production process, and market but contract  out the physical production to \\nmanufacturers in other countries. Discussions of the MNE problem often cite the rise of FGPs as related. Although FGPs are \\noften associated with the high -tech industry, Varian (2016) emphasizes that production is off -shored in many sectors (for \\nexample, a U.S. company may develop the pattern for a sweater or the design for a toy in this country and send it to a foreig n \\naffiliate to produce). Prior to 2013, a wide range of intangible capital, particularly intellectual capital, was excluded from most \\nmeasures of GDP because spending on R&D was counted as an intermediate expense. Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2009) find \\nthat as much as $800 billion of intangible ca pital was excluded from U.S. published data between 2003 and 2009. As a result \\nmore than $3 trillion of business intangible capital stock was excluded, with significant consequences for measured economic \\ngrowth and productivity. In 2013, the BEA began trea ting R&D as a fixed asset (part of investment) to address this issue (Moris \\net al., 2015). Chen, Gouma, Los, and Timmer (2017) suggest using global value chains to decompose the value of a product \\ninto the value added at each stage of production in order t o measure returns on intangible assets.  \\n17. The Guvenon et al. methods would also miss the contribution of items developed domestically that are used in production but \\ndo not generate profits because they are not proprietary, such as open -source software.  \\n18. As some commentators have pointed out, the 2017 Tax Reform Act may increase reduce profit -shifting behavior in a way that \\nreverses some of this bias (see, for example, Ip, 2017). The result would be an increase in measured GDP that does not \\ncorrespond to an i ncrease in actual GDP. As yet, the magnitude of any such effect is very unclear.  '),\n",

This sub -section offers some intuition on how \\nto split nominal GDP growth into these two components.  \\nIt helps to think about what real GDP is. It is an index of the quantity of goods and services produced \\nin a given period of time —a measure that aggregates the number of tomatoes, haircuts, tractors, and so \\non. The level of real GDP is difficult to interpr et on its own —what does an aggregate of tomatoes and \\nhaircuts mean? —but it is useful for measuring changes in production over time. A key question, then, is \\nhow changes in the production of the different goods and services are aggregated. This would not ma tter if \\nthe number of every good and service produced increased by the same amount from one year to the next —\\nsay, the economy produced 3% more of everything in year 2 than in year 1. In that case, growth in real \\nGDP obviously would be 3%. But when the prod uction of different goods increases at different rates —for \\nexample, when production increases 10% for tomatoes and 3% for haircuts but falls 2% for tractors —the \\nweights put on each category will determine what number is reported for real GDP growth.  \\nEquiv alently, real GDP growth can be viewed as the growth in nominal GDP less inflation. As noted \\nabove, real GDP is mainly calculated this way, as most source data capture expenditures in current prices. \\nBEA uses data on spending and producer revenues from a w ide variety of sources to calculate nominal \\nGDP, and then uses prices collected (mostly) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to deflate nominal \\nspending to calculate underlying quantities and growth rates. The key question from this perspective is \\nhow to create an inflation index when prices of different goods increase by different amounts.  \\nTwo different economic frameworks have been used to divide nominal GDP into inflation and real \\nGDP —one that is based on the perspective of the consumer, where the de flator is called a cost -of-living \\ndeflator, and one that is based on the perspective of the producer, or a producer price index. The cost -of-\\nliving index (COLI) is sometimes called an input price index, because it is measuring the value of the \\ninputs into the consumer’s utility function, whereas the producer price index is called an output price \\nindex, because it is measuring the value to the producer of the output they produce.  \\nAs noted by Moulton (2018), BLS’s producer price index (PPI) is conceptually b ased on an output \\nprice index framework, whereas BLS’s consumer price index (CPI) is based on a cost -of-living utility -\\nbased framework. But, as we show below, the actual practices used by BLS and BEA do not correspond \\nexactly to either one of these approac hes, but are, in general, pretty good approximations of both.19  \\n4.2  Two theory -based approaches to measuring inflation and r eal GDP  \\nThe discussion that follows assumes that consumers (who are also producers) do no saving such that GDP \\n(as well as aggrega te income) equals consumption. We make this assumption to simplify the exposition, \\nnot because we think that GDP necessarily ought to capture consumption only. Also, because our aim is to \\n. . . \\n19. BEA uses a mix of PPIs and CPIs when deflating GDP, with PPIs used to deflate nominal quantities based on the revenues \\nproducers receive and CPIs used to deflate nominal quant ities based on outlays made by the consumer.

If an increase in nominal GDP does not make the consumer better off, that increase represents \\ninflation rather t han an increase in real GDP.  \\nWhen an increase in nominal GDP does make consumers better off, how do we know how much  \\nbetter off they are? Economists do not try to answer that question exactly, because we do not have a \\nreliable way of measuring welfare.20 Instead, we ask: how much has real purchasing power increased? \\nWhen prices do not change, then the answer is simply: purchasing power has increased by exactly the \\namount that nominal income has increased, and real GDP growth is equal to nominal GDP growth.  \\nSimilarly, if prices of all goods and services increase by the same amount, then the increase in purchasing \\npower and real GDP is equal to the growth in nominal GDP less the inflation rate.  \\nBut when different goods and services have different inflation ra tes—that is, when relative prices do \\nchange —the answer is less clear. How much has purchasing power increased when income stays the same \\nbut the price of one good falls, for example?  \\nTwo approaches have been used within the COLI framework to determine how  much purchasing \\npower changes when relative prices change. The first asks: “How much income would consumers have \\nneeded in period 1 (before the price change) to get the same utility as they get in period 2 (after the price \\nchange)?” The difference between  this amount of income and actual income is called the “equivalent \\nvariation.” The second asks: “How much income would consumers need in period 2 so that they are no \\nbetter off than they were in period 1?” The difference between actual income and that amou nt of income is \\nanother reasonable, but potentially different, measure of how much better off (in $ terms) consumers are \\nin period 2 after a relative price change. This amount is called the “compensating variation.”  In both \\ncases, the idea is to compare i ncome in two periods under a counterfactual where prices have not \\nchanged.  \\nThe Technical Details  \\nFigures 5a, 5b, and 5c show how to calculate equivalent and compensating variation. They are based on a \\nmodel of a simple economy of just two goods, call them  drinks (D) and food (F). For simplicity, we define \\nthe price of drinks as always equal to 1 (i.e., drinks are the numeraire). With this definition, we can read \\nthe amount of income from the intersection of the budget constraint and the Y axis. (For exampl e, if the \\nprice of D is 1 and you can buy 100 units of D if you buy no F, your income must be $100.)  In period 1, \\nconsumers maximize utility by choosing bundle D 1 and F 1, on indifference curve U 1.  \\nAn improvement in the technology of producing F (say the introduction of an improved seed lowers \\nthe relative price of F in period 2. The budget constraint shifts out, nominal income increases from Y 1 to \\nY2 and consumers buy D 2 units of D and F 2 units of F.  \\n. . . \\n20. That is, we think welfare depends on real purchasing power, but typically do not quantify the relationship between real \\npurchasing power and welfare. See footnote 25 for more detail.  '),\n",

I t is only when relative prices change that the two \\nmeasures yield different answers.24 \\nThe geometric average of the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes is generally a very good approximation \\nof the average of the theoretically precise quantity indexes, whether fr om the consumer perspective or the \\nproducer’s perspective (Diewert, 1976, Triplett, 1993). That means that, given chaining, the index used by \\nBEA to calculate real GDP is conceptually  a very good approximation of the change in economic welfare, \\ndefined in monetary terms, using either the consumer’s perspective or the producer’s perspective. That is, \\nabstracting from the important questions of scope we discussed in the first section of the paper, real GDP \\ngrowth as measured by the BEA is a good proxy for the  change in real resources available to a society, \\nwhich is the closest we can get to the change in welfare.25  \\nThe conclusion that the change in real GDP represents the change in (the monetary value of) welfare \\nfrom the market economy is sometimes disputed.  We attempt to provide intuition and dispel some related \\nmisconceptions in several ways. In Boxes 1 and 2, we address the sometimes -heard idea that “GDP is a \\nrectangle but consumer surplus is a triangle so they are not the same.” Box 1 provides a numerical  \\nexample with a production function and a utility function to show how changes in real GDP are a good \\nproxy for the changes in welfare that one would calculate using the theoretically -precise CV and EV. Box 2 \\nprovides a graphical analysis to show that the change in real GDP from a price change is essentially \\nequivalent to the change in consumer surplus associated with that price change. (As shown by Willig \\n(1996), consumer surplus, the area above the price line under the demand curve, is itself a reasonable  \\napproximation of the theoretically ideal CV and EV measures of the welfare changes arising from a price \\nchange.) In Box 3, we discuss why “the paradox of diamonds and water,” which explains why the price of a \\ngood may not equal its value to the consumer, is not inconsistent with the view that changes in real GDP \\nmeasure changes in welfare.  \\nA numerical e xample  \\nTo demonstrate the quality of the approximation, consider the following example. Assume that the only \\ninput to producing D and F is labor, and that the amount of labor is 100. The consumer’s utility function is \\nU = log(F) + log(D). In the first year, the production function is D = 𝐿𝐷1/2 and F = 𝐿𝐹1/3. There is a \\ntechnological advance in the production of F in period 2. In the second period, F = 𝐿𝐹2/5. With this simple \\nsetup, if we assume that the equilibrium is one where consumers and producers are maximizing utility \\nand profits, respectively, we can calculate the BEA’s chained price and quantity indexes, as well the \\ntheoretically -accurate cost -of-living index and output -price index.   \\n. . . \\n24. In other words, as noted above, if prices do not change, then the change in real GDP is equal to the change in nominal GDP. I f \\nprices all change by the same amount —and relative prices do not change —then the change in real GDP is equal to the \\nchange in nomi nal GDP less the rate of price change.  \\n25. To be more concrete  and technically precise : Consider the indirect utility function V(Y,P a, Pb…). Define a cost -of-living index P \\nas the price index that satisfies:  V(Y/P) = V(Y,P a, Pb,...). That is, a cost -of-living price index is defined as the price index that \\ncaptures the changes in welfare arising from changes in the prices of the underlying goods.  \\nDefine V(Y/P) = 𝜆̅ (Y/P) where 𝜆̅ is the average utility of real income . Real GDP is Y/P, or nominal GDP deflated by a cost -of-\\nliving index. It is a measure of consumers ’ real purchasing power. 𝜆 ̅is the parameter that translates real resources into utility . If \\n𝜆̅ is constant, then, real GDP is proportional to welfare . If the average utility of income changes with  real GDP —for example, if \\n𝜆̅ declin es as real income increases —GDP will not capture this change , and it is not intended to . But holding 𝜆 ̅constant, \\nwelfare is directly proportional to real GDP .   '),\n",

Why is that? It is because, in equilibrium in \\nthis simple economy, market prices represent both the ratio of marginal production costs of the two goods \\nand the ratio of marginal utilities.  \\nWe concluded above that the  deflators used by BEA yield a measure of real GDP change that is in \\ngeneral a good measure of the change in consumer welfare (measured in monetary terms) and the change \\nin production. This example validates the conclusion quantitatively and, relatedly, shows that the two \\ndeflators concepts are very similar in practice, suggesting that the choice of deflator should not matter \\nmuch to the interpretation of real GDP as a measure of well -being.

D is drinks, F is food, and L is labor. The first year production functions are: D = LD1/2  F \\n= LF1/3. The seco nd year production functions are: D = LD1/2  F = LF2/5. The utility function is U = log(D) + log (F) and L = \\n100 in both years.  \\n4.4  Quality change and new g oods  \\nThe discussion above assumed that the quality of goods and services was fixed, so that the onl y way that \\nproduction and welfare could increase was for the actual quantities of goods and services to increase. In \\nreality, of course, the quality of goods and services changes over time, and these quality improvements \\nalso yield improvements in welfare and GDP. That is, instead of having more  goods and services, real GDP \\nand welfare can improve by having better  goods and services.  \\nIn order to use the formulas described above to compute changes in real GDP when the quality of \\ngoods and services improves, two often -unobserved prices are needed: the price of year -1-quality items in \\nyear 2 (to compute how much the year 1 basket would have cost with year 2 prices) and the price of year -\\n2-quality items in year 1 (to compute how much the year 2 basket would have  cost in year 1). With these \\nprices, everything flows through as above.  \\nAlthough these prices are unobserved, it is possible to impute them in some cases.

People purchase goods and services because they value their underlying \\ncharacteristics. Under this approach, when a good’s quality improves, that good must now embody more \\nof a particular characteristic. If  the characteristics can be measured and priced, then it is possible to \\nimpute the prices for items of different qualities. For example, if you know in a particular year that each \\nadditional 100 square feet in a house raises the selling price by 5%, then i t is possible to impute prices of \\nhouses with various square footages. If, in year 2, the average square footage of houses has increased, it is \\npossible to know what those houses would have sold for last year; similarly, it is possible to know what \\nsmaller  houses (year 1 houses) would sell for this year.  \\nIn a simple world where the set of embodied characteristics is fixed,  there would be no issue of \\nchanges in quality if characteristics were priced instead of goods. This caveat about a fixed set of \\ncharact eristics is important. It means that “better” goods and services are just combinations of existing \\ngoods and services. For example, an increase in the size of a cereal box might mean the cereal box is \\n“better”, but one could have purchased as much cereal b efore by buying two (smaller) boxes. Similarly, an \\nincrease in computer “MIPS” – millions of instructions per second —means that you need fewer \\ncomputers to accomplish a particular task, but that task was doable the year before as well. When all \\ncharacteris tics exist in two consecutive years, the necessary adjustment for quality change is theoretically \\nstraightforward and intuitive, as we show in Case 1 below.  \\nWhen a product improvement creates something that is actually new —an improvement in a medical \\ntreat ment that increases survival, a cell phone app that allows users to figure out where their kids are, a \\nprinter that can print in 3 -D, etc. then market data alone won’t be sufficient to impute the prices \\nnecessary to calculate the indexes described above (b ecause the item did not exist previously). In that \\ncase, a quality improvement has to be treated as a new good. In this section, we provide an overview of \\nhow to account for quality when the characteristics approach applies and when a good needs to be trea ted \\nas new.  \\nCase 1: Quality Improvements Embodying More of Existing Characteristics  \\nTable 2 presents a very simple example to demonstrate this approach. Imagine that instead of buying \\n“food”, the consumer buys “boxes of cereal.”  What goes into consumers’ utility function is not the box of \\ncereal, of course, but the cereal itself. Imagine  that there is no change in the underlying production \\ntechnology for the economy —both a unit of cereal and a unit of drinks need the same amount of labor to \\nproduce in period 1 as in period 2 —but for some reason, producers have decided to sell cereal in la rger \\nboxes —let’s say doubling the cereal content — and the price of the box of cereal goes up accordingly.  \\nTable 2 shows how this increase in quality can distort measured prices and quantities using Fisher \\n(geometric average of Laspeyres and Paasche) quant ity and price indexes for both. The price of a box of \\ncereal doubles, because it contains double the cereal. Nominal GDP —which is equal to total nominal \\nspending (the number of drinks times the price of a drink (1) plus the \\\\number of cereal boxes times th e \\nbox price) is unchanged. Without making an adjustment for this improved quality, though, it looks like \\nprices increased 41% and real GDP decreased 29% (using Fisher ideal indexes to calculate both). But it is \\nobvious that real GDP and prices would be unc hanged with appropriate quality adjustments to the price \\nof cereal boxes.27 \\n. . . \\n27. Triplett (2004) argues that this package size adjustment is too simple, because the relationship between volume and price is \\ngenerally not linear —that is, bigger boxes usually sell at a lower price per unit. We ignore this issue in order to provide a simple \\nexample that gives the basic intuition of quality adjustments.  '),\n",

It is intuitively obvious that one would adjust the price \\nof the cereal box for the change in quant ity. But the exact same issues arise when the underlying \\ncharacteristic may be not so easily observed and when products can improve on multiple dimensions.  \\nWhen the proper quality adjustment is not so obvious, two approaches have been advocated. One is \\nbased on cost, which is generally linked to the producer’s perspective and the output -price index. The \\nother is based on utility, which is viewed as the appropriate method for the consumer’s cost -of-living -\\nindex perspective. It is helpful to compare these tw o methods in this simple case.  \\nCost -based method .

Subtracting that from the price, the quality -adjusted price is $2.  \\nThe cost -plus -markup method is a way of directly estimating the prices that period -1 and period -2 \\nboxes would have sold for in the market had they been sold. A com mon approach to gathering those \\nprices is to use hedonic functions – regressions that relate selling prices to the characteristics of the goods \\nand services sold in a given year.  \\nThe basic idea of hedonic regressions is that, if there are enough different  models of similar goods \\nwith varying amounts of underlying characteristics, a regression analysis, using cross -sectional variation \\nwithin a given year, can uncover how much having more of certain characteristics contributes to a price. \\nWith this regressio n, any given combination of characteristics can be priced.29  \\nThe utility -based method does not try to directly measure the prices at which the goods would be sold \\nbut the difference in value to the consumer of the different quality items. The utility -based  method yields \\nthe same answer because, in equilibrium for most goods, people purchase goods and services until their \\nmarginal value equals their price.  \\nThe equivalence between a cost -plus -markup quality adjustment and a utility -based adjustment \\nbreaks do wn when a quality improvement introduces a characteristic that was not available previously. \\nWe go through that case now, and argue that the utility -based approach is the appropriate one when the \\ntwo approaches differ.  \\nCase 2. Quality improvements that i ntroduce something n ew \\nWhen a quality improvement introduces a characteristic that was not available previously, the good can \\nbe viewed as a “new” good. New goods might be, for example, treatments that increase survival time for \\ncancer, the smartphone, or th e laptop. The value to society of a new good is the difference between the \\nvalue people place on the new characteristic embedded in the new model and its cost.  \\nStandard methods that attempt to measure the prices of new goods in the previous year (hedonics or \\nthe cost method) are likely to be unsuccessful, since the goods did not exist. For example, when a camera \\nis first added to a phone, there are simply no observations with cell phone cameras in the previous year’s \\ndata, so no way to infer what such a pro duct would have sold for.  \\nAs Hicks first showed (Triplett, 2004), the correct price to use for the previous year’s price is the \\nconsumer’s reservation price30— the lowest price at which consumers would not purchase the good.31  As \\nshown in Figure 8 , the decline in price from the reservation price to the introduction price will capture the \\nconsumer surplus that consumers derive from the introduction of the good.  \\n. . . \\n29. Of course, this is putting a funct ional form on the relationship between characteristics and prices. Plugging in characteristics \\nthat are very different in magnitude from the ones actually observed will likely be quite problematic. For example, a regress ion \\nof house prices on square footag e might not do a very good job predicting the cost of a 100 square foot house, or a 50,000 \\nsquare foot house, if the range of houses actually observed in the data range from 1000 to 7000 square feet.  \\n30. This is obviously the correct price from the consumer’s  perspective. From the producer’s perspective, the correct price might \\nbe: at what price would you have produced this new product last year, but that price might be infinity if the technology simp ly \\ndid not exist.  \\n31. When a new good that is just a combination  of existing characteristics is introduced, the reservation price is equal to the price \\nof the characteristics in the previous year, so this method works for any good.

Consumer surplus from new goods  \\n \\n \\n \\nIt is not always clear when a good is new, versus when it simply represents a rebundling of existing \\ncharacteristics. One important case where this situation arises is when there is a technological limit that \\nmeans that people cannot get as much of a characteristic as they like, holding all else eq ual. This could be \\nthe case for computer chips that increase computing power without increasing the size of the chip, \\nallowing for the production of laptops, smart phones, smart watches, etc., and many other areas where \\ninnovation is pushing the technologi cal frontier. In these cases, the hedonic method may appear feasible —\\nbecause characteristics (like computing power, for example) might not appear new —but something about \\nthe improvement is introducing a characteristic that was not available before, and, as  Triplett (2004) \\nnotes, “the arrival of a new characteristic cannot be evaluated satisfactorily with hedonic methods.”  \\nOne important area where this issue arises is in medical advances. Consider an example where \\nconsumption equals the consumption of every thing excluding medical treatments. Assume that people \\nundergo medical treatments not because they get utility directly from them, but because they get \\nincreased longevity —that is, years of life is the “characteristic” that goes into the utility function.32 A \\n. . . \\n32. As discussed above, the treatment of consumer durables in the national accounts is a sou rce of mismeasurement. Instead of \\ncounting consumer durables purchases in investment, and then also imputing a return on them over their service life (the way \\nthe accounts treat owner -occupied housing), they are treated as if they are entirely consumed in the year purchased. The \\nsame criticism can be applied to spending on medical care, much of which can be viewed as an investment in human capital \\nthat yields returns over many years. Recognizing that medical care is durable should not change the correction for quality —the \\nquality adjusted price of medical care should still include a correction for the present value of the additional years of lif e. \\nHowever, that value should then be spread out over many years as an imputed service flow into consumption, just as with \\nowner -occupied housing. Similarly, Corrado and Byrne (2017) argue that spending on many consumer digital services, like \\nprograms that are purchased and then used for several years, should be counted as investment.  \\nP '),\n",

This is essentially a hedonic approach that attempts to correct improvements in treatment over \\ntime by subtracting out the effect of the quality improvement on price. This is basica lly the approach \\ntaken by Romley, Goldman, and Sood (2014) in measuring the productivity of health spending.33 In \\ncontrast, the consumer’s cost -of-living utility -based perspective would value these improvements at the \\nmarginal value of life. This approach i s taken by Lakdawalla et al.  (2015) and Cutler et al. (1998, 2001). \\nOf course, to implement this approach, it is necessary to have a reasonable measure of how much \\nconsumers value an increase in a year of life, and this measure cannot be gleaned from the data on \\nmedical spending itself. In practice, valuations of a year of life are derived from research that assesses how \\nmuch people need to be compensated in order to take on risk. For instance, Viscusi and Aldi (2003) \\nsummarize the findings of over 100 stu dies that estimate the value of life using mortality and injury risk \\npremiums.34   \\nEfforts to compare these two approaches with actual data show that they yield very different \\napproaches. Sheiner and Malinovskaya (2016), for example, use data from 1984 to 1 994 from Cutler et al \\n(2001) to show that a price index that subtracts the estimated value of additional life -years for heart \\nattack treatment shows large declines in quality -adjusted prices, whereas a price index that subtracts the \\nestimated market price of the additional years of life shows much smaller declines. They also show that \\neven when the price of the valued characteristic – years of life – increases, the consumer can still be better \\noff.  \\nDauda et al (2017) use that insight to compare these two types of quality adjustment with more recent \\ndata for three different treatments: treatment of heart attacks, heart disease, and pneumonia. They find \\nsimilar results for all three conditions, with utility -based treatments showing much larger price declines  \\nthan cost -based quality adjustments. Their findings for heart attack treatment, for exa mple, are \\nreproduced in Figure 9 .35 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n. . . \\n33. Romley et al actually calculate t he spending per year of life, like the cereal example above. Sheiner and Malinovskaya (2016) \\nshow that this is the same as the cost option assuming that costs are linear in years of life, but won’t be the same if there  are \\nother attributes of a treatment t hat affect cost.  \\n34. Federal agencies such as the Department of Transportation, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental \\nProtection Agency depend on these types of studies to value statistical lives when estimating the benefits or costs of polic ies \\nthat affect life expectancy. None of the agencies allows the value of a life to depend on age, and, equivalently, none of the m \\nplace a value on an additional year of life. (Aldy and Viscusi, 2007).  \\n35. In that figure, the BP and unadjusted index are basica lly the current price index, the TE measures the change in the price of a \\nsuccessful treatment over time, and the LE index subtracts the marginal value of the quality improvement in heart attack \\ntreatment from the price, where the value of an additional ye ar of life is assumed to be $100,000.

See Dauda et al (2017) for details.  \\n \\nWhy are the results in this scenario diffe rent from those shown above? They are different because, \\neven in equilibrium, the cost of an additional year of life is not the same as the value placed on that \\nadditional year of life by consumers.  \\nTo illustrate this point concretely, imagine that an addi tional year of life is worth $50,000.36 In period \\n1, the cost of a cancer treatment is $30,000, and it increases survival by one year. In period 2, the \\ntreatment has improved and has become more expensive.

If consumers could have \\npurchased as many years of life as they wanted at $30,000 per year in period 1, then they would be worse \\noff in period 2. But because this is no t feasible, they are better off in period 2: they pay $40,000 more \\nthan in the previous year, but what they get is valued at $50,000. A cost -of-living index would show a \\ndecline  in the price of health.  \\nNote that in both cases, adjusting for quality lowers  the inflation rate of medical treatments relative to \\nan unadjusted price . The unadjusted price of treatment increases from $30,000 to $70,000, or 133%. \\nBut:  \\n. . . \\n36.

Subtracting the cost of the improvement \\nwill yield a different result than subtracting the utility value.

In Table 3, we \\ncompare the cost and utility methods of quality adjustment for a number of different cases. Sc enario 1 is \\nthe one described above, where the cost method yields no increase in real GDP, and the utility method \\nyields a 5% increase in real GDP.  \\nNow, consider a different scenario, which we call Scenario 2 in the table. When the new treatment is \\nfirst discovered, it costs an additional $50,000, just equal to the value consumers put on it. There is no \\nincrease in consumer surplus or real GDP, regardless of the quality adjustment method used. But in the \\nyear after the original discovery (year 3), research ers figure out how to make the new treatment more \\ncheaply, and the cost and price both fall by $10,000. In Scenario 2, the economy in year 3 has a treatment \\nworth $50,000 that costs $40,000 to produce, the same situation as in Scenario 1, but taking a year  \\nlonger to get there. There is no question that the fall in treatment price from $50,000 to $40,000 from \\nyear 2 to year 3 should and would be counted as a price decline, because the quality of the treatment is the \\nsame in both years. Taking account of this  price decline shows that using both the utility method and the \\ncost method  real GDP has increased 5%. It seems obvious that the change in real GDP should be the same \\nin both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 (since consumption is exactly the same by year 3), thus  showing that the \\ncost-based method isn’t a reliable measure of GDP change when the innovation is a new good.  \\nFinally, imagine that, instead of pricing the drug at cost, the company was able to price it at the \\nconsumer value, or $50,000. This is Scenario 3  in the table. Using the cost -method (where cost plus \\nmarkup is subtracted) and recognizing that profits and nominal income will rise when prices exceed costs, \\nwe find that real GDP increases 5%, the same as with the utility -based method. This also shows t hat the \\nconsumer surplus from an innovation is equal to the utility value of it less its production costs. Whether \\nthe good is priced at cost or at value should only determine the split between consumers and producers, \\nnot the overall effect on GDP.39  \\n Sum mary  \\nThe use of chained indexes means that, for goods and services with constant quality, it does not matter \\nmuch whether you use an output price or a cost -of-living price, and, in any case, the current methodology \\nis a very good approximation of both. Whe n the set of characteristics of goods is fixed, but goods and \\nservices improve over time because they contain more of certain characteristics, there is similarly no \\ndifference in the quality -adjusted price using either the cost method or the utility method . But when a new \\ncharacteristic is introduced, either as a quality adjustment to an existing good, or as an entirely new good, \\nprevailing prices in the year before introduction will not yield the correct result for GDP, and a utility -\\nbased approach is nece ssary.   \\n. . . \\n39. This conclusion is ignoring the inefficiencies associated with monopoly power, which would limit the consumption of the new \\ngood and thus lead to a smaller increase in consumer surplus and real GDP.

How d oes BLS  actually adjust for quality c hanges?  \\nThe data requirements to actually quality adjust prices in a completely theoretically -appropriate way are \\nsubstantial and unlikely to be availabl e to BLS, particularly in real time.40 BLS does not really tackle the \\nissue of new goods or quality improvements that represent new characteristics. Instead, what BLS tries to \\nensure is that price increases that are directly attributable to quality increase s are not counted as inflation. \\nIn the cereal example above, say, BLS would want to make sure that the price increase stemming from the \\nintroduction of a larger cereal box is stripped out from the observed market price of the larger cereal \\nbox.41 Although BLS makes no attempt to directly measure the utility value from new goods and quality \\nimprovements that introduce new characteristics, we show that their methods will sometimes capture the \\nconsumer surplus from these innovations indirectly.  \\nBLS c ollect prices on a fixed set of goods and services sold at a fixed set of outlets, with new outlets \\nand new goods and services rotated in regularly.42 They use a number of methods to derive inflation \\nindexes from these data.  \\n(1) The matched model : the basic met hod used by BLS and by far the most common way goods and \\nservices are priced. The matched model collects the prices of a specific model (made by the same \\nmanufacturer and sold in the same store at the same location) from one month to the next.  \\nThe matched  model is only feasible when the product in the BLS sample is sold in two adjacent \\nperiods.43 When a match is not available (because a product is not sold anymore or is unavailable), BLS \\nuses other methods of trying to impute the price it would have sold at :  \\n(2) Hedonic regression analysis : a method that specifies that the price of a good is a function of its \\ncharacteristics.   \\n(3) The direct cost method : a method that adjusts a new good for the cost of the product \\nimprovement. That is, when a new model of a good is  better than the old model, they subtract the \\ncost (plus markup) of the improvement from the price.  \\n. . . \\n40. Putting a number on the overall bias in consumer prices is very difficult, particularly when the degree of bias has changed over \\ntime given changes in data -construction practices and in the economy. Groshen, Moyer, Aizcorbe, Bradley, and Friedman \\n(2017) summarizes some of the literature that has attempte d to do so. For example, Lebow and Rudd (2003) estimated that \\nCPI growth was biased upward by 0.87 percentage points per year as of 2001.  Reinsdorf and Schreyer  (2018) estimate that \\nadjusting for new goods and quality changes related to the digital economy  would reduce growth in the PCE deflator in 2015 by \\na maximum of 0.58 percentage point per year.  \\n41. As noted above, this discussion abstracts from any disutility consumers might get from having to purchase in bulk.  \\n42. For the CPI, the BLS selects new item and ou tlet samples, on a rotating basis, for approximately 25 percent of item strata \\nevery year (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018).

This \\nprice change is then used to deflate all the expenditures in a particular category. Because the exact same \\nitem is priced over time, quality improvements cannot be mislabeled as price increases.  \\nAs a simple example of how the model is used, consider the example of the introduction of the iPhone \\n8. Assume that iPhon es are in the sample of goods and services that BLS tracks. There would be no match \\nfor the iPhone 8 in the period of its introduction (though there would be in subsequent periods), and, if \\nthe price of the iPhone 7 did not change in this period, then the matched model would imply that there \\nhad been no changes in iPhone prices. All increases in spending on IPhones (both 7s and 8s) would be \\ncounted as increases in real cellphone spending.44 For example, if the price of the iPhone 7 was $600 in \\nboth years, an d the iPhone 8 was introduced at $650, none of the increase in the iPhone price from the 7 \\nto the 8 would be counted as inflation.  \\nAs this example shows, the matched model can only handle quality changes if the older model \\ncontinues to be sold even after t he newer model is introduced. If the iPhone 7 had been discontinued \\nwhen the iPhone 8 was introduced, BLS would not be able to collect any price information for it, and the \\nmatched model could not be used.  \\nAssuming that an existing model continues to be so ld alongside a new model, so that the matched \\nmodel is feasible, how well does the matched model do at accounting for quality improvements?  That is, \\nusing the matched model, will a technological innovation increase real GDP by the difference between the \\naverage value of the innovation to consumers and the cost of producing it? Or, in other words, will the \\nchange in prices from the matched model be a good proxy for the change in prices for all the models that \\nare sold (where the change in the price for a ne w model is the change from its reservation price)?  \\nThe answer is that it depends on how the innovation is priced and how the prices of the continuing \\ngoods that BLS tracks respond. In the case of a quality improvement that is just a rebundling of available  \\ncharacteristics, like the cereal example above, the answer is likely to be yes. In the specific cereal example, \\nwhere there was only one characteristic, the change in the price of the smaller box of cereal would be a \\nperfect proxy for the change in the pr ice of the larger box, because both were determined by the \\nunderlying price for cereal. More generally, so long as the characteristics of the goods that are sold \\ncontinuously are close to those included in the new model, the price changes should be similar  and the \\nmatched model will do a reasonable job.45 \\n. . . \\n44. It is important to distinguish between increases in real spending on cellphones and increases in real GDP. If spending on \\niPhones increases, and nominal income has not changed, then spending on other goods and services must be declining. If the \\nprice of iPhones doesn’t change when the iPhone 8 is introduced, and if profits from the IPhone don’t increase, then the \\nintroduction if the iPhone 8 will not have an effect o n measured real GDP. If, on the other hand, Apple’s profits increase from \\nthe introduction of the iPhone 8, then both nominal and real GDP increases.  \\n45. When the prices of different characteristics change at different rates, the actual change in the price of  any given model will \\ndepend on its exact mix of characteristics. Some upward bias is possible here if new models systematically provide more of th e \\ncharacteristics that have experienced price declines and less of the characteristics whose prices have incr eased.

The gains from the \\ninnovation —the difference between the average value of the innovation to consumers and the average cost \\nof producing it —will be split between producers and consumers. The producers share —the increase in \\nprofits —will be counted in nominal and real GDP.46 In the extreme case of a producer who is able to \\nextract all the consumer surplus from an innovation, all o f the benefit of the innovation would end up in \\nprofits, and would therefore be in GDP. In this case, there would be no decline in quality -adjusted price \\nfrom the innovation —because the change in the value would be equal to the change in the price —and the \\nmatched model would get the change in quality -adjusted prices and the change in real GDP correct.47  \\nHowever, if there is some consumer surplus from the new innovation, then the degree to which it is \\ncaptured by the matched model will depend on the price re sponse to the innovation by its competitors. \\nLet’s use the iPhone example again. Assume the iPhone 8 is worth $150 more to consumers, on average, \\nthan the iPhone 7, but is priced at only $50 more. Consumers get $100 of consumer surplus by buying the \\niPhone  8. If the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 7 were perfect substitutes, Apple could only continue to sell \\nIPhone 7s if it lowered their price by $100. If the iPhone 7 price fell by $100 when the iPhone 8 was \\nintroduced, then the matched model would register this as  a decline in the price of cellphones and apply it \\nto all iPhone purchases. iPhone prices would fall, and, even if nominal spending on IPhones is unchanged, \\nreal cellphone spending would increase.48   \\nIn general, one would not expect prices of competing goo ds to adjust fully. The degree of price \\nadjustment expected would depend on how much a new model substituted for an existing model, the cost \\nstructure of the competitor, and the competitors’ market power.49 Consider the introduction of Uber and \\nLyft, which many believe provide a superior service to taxis at a lower price. It may be that taxis continue \\nto operate (at reduced market shares) and taxi prices do not decline because the costs of providing tax \\nservices have not changed or because prices are regulat ed. In this case, monitoring the price of taxis (the \\nmatched service) will not provide a measure of the consumer surplus derived from the introduction of \\nUber and Lyft, and that consumer surplus will be missing from GDP.  \\nOr consider a situation where it is  not the good that changes, but the retailer. For example, consider \\nthe introduction of a low -priced supplier into a market —perhaps Walmart or an online retailer —and \\nassume that these suppliers are able to provide lower prices because they have figured out  how to lower \\nthe costs of operation. The matched model considers the products sold at Walmart and Amazon as \\ndifferent goods than the products sold at Safeway, so the fact that the introduction of Walmart might have \\n. . . \\n46. On the income side, profits go directly into the accounts. On the expenditure side, the profits will either be saved and end up as \\ninvestment purchases or will be used to finance consumption, both of which will also be captured.  \\n47. Reinsdorf and Schreyer (2018) point out that the typical pattern for high -tech goods is for manufacturers to introduce them at \\nhigh prices and then to let prices fall over time (this may be a form of price discrimination). In this case, getting the new  goods \\ninto the BL S sample more quickly could help improve GDP measurement, because the price declines from the initially high \\nintroductory price would be picked up and more of the consumer surplus from new goods would be captured in GDP.  \\n48. The increase in consumer s urplus fr om the lower price on i Phone 7s would be offset by lower profits on their sale. On net, o nly \\nthe consumer surplus from the i Phone 8s would  be added to real GDP (yielding the correct answer).  \\n49. Feenstra (1994) shows that the degree of overstatement of prices from only examining prices of continuing goods depends on \\nboth the degree of substitutability of new goods for old goods and the shares of spending allocated to new goods once they ar e \\nintroduced. The introduction of a new good If competitors lower prices,  then the shares of spending allocated to new models \\nwill be lower.  '),\n",

This bias is not limited to the introduction \\nof new retail outlets. It can apply to services —for example, the introduction of a new discount health \\ninsurer in a market could result in lower prices for health care that would never be captured as a price \\ndecrease if existing insurers don’t also lower their prices. It might even apply more broadly. For example, \\nif people move from one city to another to take advantage of a lower cost of living, consumer price indexes \\nwill never reflect the declin e in the cost of living.  \\nThese are all examples where the matched model overstates inflation and understates real GDP. \\nHowever, the opposite might also occur. Prices of old models that are on their way to being pushed out by \\nnewer models might sell for fi re sale prices, as retailers try to get rid of their inventory. The matched \\nmodel might overstate price declines in this case. Similarly, companies might use the introduction of a \\nnew model as an opportunity to raise prices, but might leave the price of th eir old model unchanged. \\nBecause the old model price does not change, the matched model will miss this inflation, and will call all \\nadditional spending on the new model an increase in real spending.  \\nAs we noted above, the matched model is BLS’s workhorse, and, in most cases, is used whenever a \\nmatch is available. When a match is no longer available, either because the product is simply out of stock \\nor has been discontinued, BLS employs a few alternative methods.  \\n5.2  Direct cost m ethod  \\nWhen a direct match is not available, BLS will sometimes link a new product to an old product by \\nadjusting the price of the new product for the cost of the improvement (plus the producer’s markup).53 For \\n. . . \\n50. Because Walmart and Safeway coexist, one could argue that the amenities provided by Walmart must be inferior to those \\nprovided by Safeway, otherwise Walmart would drive out Safeway. But th e fact that Walmart has gained market share \\nsuggests that the introduction of Walmart into a market does provide consumer surplus. Interestingly, BLS decided in 1995 to \\ntreat generic drugs (sold by a different manufacturer than brand name drugs) as the sam e product as brand name drugs, even \\nthough the brand name drugs continue to exist (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). The rapid expansion of online retailers may  \\nlead to similar problems to the Walmart -Safeway example above. A recent paper by Goolsbee and Klenow (2018) found that \\ninflation for goods sold online is 1.3 percentage points per year lower than for the same categories of goods in the standard  \\nCPI.  \\n51. And, as in the IPhone example, if Safeway lowers its prices without managing to lower its costs, th e price savings to \\nconsumers at Safeway will be offset in GDP by lower Safeway profits.  \\n52. Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2017) point  out how changes in the pricing behavior of chip manufacturers caused the matched \\nmodel  to fail. They note that, in the past, when  a more powerful chip was introduced to the market, the prices of older chips fell, \\nleading the matched model  to register large declines in computer chip prices. But the pricing strategy changed, such that listed \\nprices of existing chips no longer declined  so much, despite continuing improvements in chips, leading the matched model  to \\nmiss the continuing productivity in that sector . \\n53. Although the direct cost method uses “cost” terminology, BLS makes clear that the cost includes the producer’s markup.

If \\nusing the direct cost method, the BLS would have asked Apple how much of the increase in the price of \\nthe iPhone 8 relative to the iPhone 7 was due to the cost (plus markup) of the improvements, and \\nsubtracted that from the pri ce. If Apple says the entire increase in price was due to the improvements, \\nthen the quality -adjusted price of the iPhone 8 would be equal to the price of the iPhone 7.  \\nAs we saw above, whether this is the correct quality adjustment or not depends on Apple ’s pricing \\nbehavior.54 If Apple is able to extract the entire increase in consumer surplus from the iPhone 8, then a \\nquality -adjustment that shows no decline in prices would be correct. But if consumers do get consumer \\nsurplus, so that the correct quality -adjusted price has declined, the direct cost method will not get this \\nright.  \\nIn general, with downward sloping demand functions, we expect the introduction of truly new goods \\nto be associated with consumer surplus, which the direct cost method would not ca pture.  \\n5.3  Hedonic r egression  \\nAs noted above, hedonic regression is a useful way of imputing prices for products that are simply bundles \\nof existing characteristics.55 A well -specified hedonic regression will do a good job of imputing a price that \\na good would have been sold at had it been available. So, when an existing good disappears, a hedonic \\nregression can be used to impute the price it would have sold at. For exa mple, if the iPhone 7 had \\ndisappeared, but other cellphones on the market had very similar characteristics, the price of the iPhone 7 \\ncould be imputed. If other older models of phones experienced price drops when the iPhone 8 was \\nintroduced, then that coul d be picked up with the use of hedonics.   \\nThe use of hedonics cannot overcome the basic problem identified with the matched model, however. \\nIt can only capture the consumer surplus from the introduction of truly new quality improvements (i.e., \\nnew charact eristics) if the prices of competitors decline. Nothing in the market data on selling prices and \\ncharacteristics of goods can uncover the price a new good would have sold at in the period before it was \\nintroduced —the consumer’s reservation price —because th ere are no observations with that characteristic.  \\n5.4  Imputations  \\nThe matched model and hedonics may capture part of the benefits of new innovations, but are likely to \\nleave quite a bit unmeasured. The problem is magnified when a new innovation is good enough that it \\npushes potential competitors out of business. Then, there will be no close products to price using either \\nthe matched model or hedonic regressions. Similarly, a truly new product —like the smartphone —may not \\nreally have any competitors.  \\nIn both these cases, the price changes used by BLS to deflate will consist of price changes for other \\nitems that are being followed. Because it is systematically dropping items that likely would have \\nexperienced price declines had they stayed in the basket, th e inflation measure will be biased upward.  \\nImagine in the example of taxis and Uber, for example, that Uber was such a good replacement for \\ntaxis that it pushed them completely out of the business. Then the matched model for taxi services could \\n. . . \\n54. Note that, regardless of what is assumed about the quality -adjusted price of the IPhone, changes in actual profits will be \\ncaptured in nominal GDP.  \\n55.

In this example, BLS would likely just \\nuse the price changes for other types of services in “intracity mass transit” —like the price change for \\nlimousines —as a proxy for the inflation in the category as a whole.  \\nSimilarly, imagine if big box stores push mom and pops out of a market, because these stores could \\nnot lower their costs enough to be co mpetitive. With the retail outlet missing, BLS would simply drop that \\noutlet from its sample.  This upward bias to inflation from the selective exiting of certain goods and \\nservices from BLS sample (and from the market) imparts an upward bias to inflation a nd therefore a \\ndownward bias to GDP and productivity. Aghion et al (2017) have labeled this missing productivity from \\n“creative destruction.”  \\n5.5  Other quality changes that are not c aptured  \\nConsumer Services . While the matched model has much appeal for goods, it is harder to think about \\nmatching a specific model for services. BLS can price the same medical treatment over time, the cost of \\nhaving a will written, or the price of man’s haircut, but unlike with goods where there are exact replicas \\nbased on m odel numbers, it is difficult to hold the quality constant over time in the case of services. \\nConsider the benefits of requiring pilots or surgeons to use safety checklists, for example. Airline flights or \\nsurgeries after the implementation of these checkl ists would not be viewed as new models under the BLS \\napproach, and thus the benefits of these improvements would be missed. Other costly innovations, \\nincluding the use of better inputs like better equipment in the plane or better sutures for surgery, might  \\nalso be missed.  \\nGovernment and non -profits . Because the services produced by governments and non -profits are not \\nsold in the market place, there is no sense in which the prices over time can be compared.  Instead, BLS \\nuses changes in the costs of the inpu ts (labor, material, supplies, etc.) to deflate changes in nominal \\nspending. For example, when teacher wages increase, the deflator used to deflate spending on public \\neducation increases. This method assumes  that there is no productivity growth in the prov ision of public \\nservices.56 But if teacher wages are increasing because teachers are more productive (because of an \\nincrease in their education, or because of an improvement in pedagogic methods, for example), a quality \\nadjusted price deflator would not sho w an increase in prices, but the BLS would nonetheless assume one.  \\n6.  Summary and conclusion  \\nOur goal in this paper was to explore the basic economics surrounding the measurement of GDP. We have \\nfocused, in particular, on the question of whether GDP shoul d be viewed as a measure of economic well -\\nbeing. Our ultimate goal is to understand the extent to which productivity growth captures changes in \\nliving standards, but we have limited ourselves in this paper to discussing GDP, the numerator in \\nproductivity.  \\nWe separated the discussion into different parts. We first covered the GDP concept, focusing on how \\nwell the scope of GDP as conceptualized  aligns with aggregate economic well -being. (We recognize, but do \\nnot address, the limitations for capturing well -being of any aggregate measure that ignores the \\ndistribution of resources.) We then considered how well nominal GDP compares with the nominal \\n. . . \\n56. Indeed, the deflators for the government sector are typically higher than those for the rest of the econom y.

Finally, we consider the deflators used to \\nconvert nomina l GDP to real GDP, with a thorough exploration of the deflators that would be ideal in \\nmeasuring economic well -being and how they compare with BEA’s actual practices.   \\nOur preliminary conclusions are as follows. First, from a theoretical perspective, one would not want \\nto use real GDP per se as a comprehensive measure of aggregate economic well -being. There are some \\nimportant conceptual differences between the two concepts. For example, as a production -based measure, \\nGDP captures investment (spending that does not immediately translate into higher welfare) in addition \\nto consumption. However, some would argue that investment should be included on the grounds that it \\neventually translates into consumption. Moreover, a broad measure of private and public cons umption is \\nhighly correlated with GDP over long periods of time, suggesting that the inclusion of investment does not \\nmaterially affect the value of GDP as a measure of aggregate economic well -being over long periods of \\ntime. At higher frequencies, the gro wth rate of GDP is more volatile than that of consumption. But, that \\nfeature of GDP is useful to government officials responsible for stabilizing the economy in the face of \\nbusiness cycle fluctuations, as they are focused on the degree to which the economy  is using all of its \\nproductive resources.  \\nThat said, we believe that one conceptual difference —the exclusion of non -market activities that bear \\non economic well -being —merits more attention, particularly given the potential for changes in the \\nimportance of  such activities over time to change the degree to which changes in GDP capture changes in \\nwell-being.  \\nWe also flag a number of issues that warrant more attention when it comes to translating GDP as \\nconceptualized into GDP as measured. To start, the nation al accounts may mismeasure the nominal GDP \\narising from internet -provided “free goods” and the operation of multinationals corporations. In addition, \\nthe deflators used to separate GDP into nominal GDP and real GDP may produce biased measures of \\ninflation in some instances which, in turn, lead to biases in real GDP as measured.  \\nOur analysis showed that there are many cases in which current practices yield measures of prices \\nthat serve well as deflators, dispelling some common misconceptions along the way. We show that, by \\ndefinition, cost -of-living deflators yield changes in real GDP that measure changes in consumer surplus. \\nFurthermore, except in some specific cases, there is little difference in practice between cost -of-living \\ndeflators and output -price i ndexes. In particular, for goods and services that do not change in quality over \\ntime, current deflator methods will yield a real GDP measure that captures the change in consumer \\nsurplus fairly well.  \\nThe important exceptions to these conclusions are for p rice measures for goods and services that \\nchange in quality and for new goods and services. In these cases, current methods may not capture \\nconsumer surplus well. We believe that efforts to improve the price measures so that they better capture \\nconsumer su rplus would be very useful.  \\n '),\n",

CHANGE IN R EAL GDP  AND CHANGE IN CONSUMER S URPLUS \\n– A GRAPHICAL A NALYSIS  \\nOne of the conceptual difficulties with viewing  real GDP growth as a measure of  the change in welfare is \\nthat, to the extent economists think of GDP graphically, we think of it as a rectangle (P times Q) while we \\nthink of consumer surplus as having a triangle.  \\nBut, as we show in this simple graphical example, chained GDP, which accounts for substitution \\neffects when prices fall, also gives rise to a triangle and the change in real GDP is approximately the \\nchange in consumer surplus.  \\nAssume  a simple economy with just two goods, F and D. The price of F falls, and nominal income is \\nunchanged . The change in consumer  surplus from that price change can be read off the demand curve for \\ngood F, as shown below. (Note that this is the entire consumer surplus from the price change, even if the \\ndemand for other goods changes as a result of the change in the price of F.)  We discuss three cases.  \\nCase 1: Only the demand for good F changes as a result of the price change.  \\nIncome is unchanged, so spending on good F is the same in period 1 and period 2, which means that  P2F2 \\n= P 1F1. Thus,  in the diagram below, H + G = A + G, or H = A. In other words, the savings from the price \\ndecline (A) is used to finance increased spending on F (H).  \\n \\nChange in consumer surplus is A + B.  \\n \\nPaasche change in GDP (period 2 prices) is  \\n(F2 - F1)P2, or H. \\n \\nLaspeyres change in GDP (period 1 prices) is (F 2 - \\nF1)P1, or H+B+C.  \\n \\nAveraging Paasche and Laspeyres (approximately \\nwhat chaining does) gives you a change in GDP = \\nH + B.  \\n \\nBecause H = A, change in consumer \\nsurplus (A+B) = change in real GDP (H+B).  \\n'),\n",

HOW CAN CHANGES IN REAL GDP MEASURE CHANGES IN \\nCONSUMER S URPLUS GIVEN THE PARADOX OF  DIAMONDS AND \\nWATER?  \\nSome people use the intuition from the “paradox of diamonds and water” —which explains why diamonds \\nare more expensive than water even though water is essential  to life and hence obviously more valuable — \\nto argue that welfare is much bigger than GDP because many goods (like water) are much more valuable \\nto consumers than what they pay for them. Since nominal GDP is what people pay for the goods they buy, \\nthey arg ue, welfare must be greater than GDP . Another way of stating the argument is that GDP weighs \\nthe quantities of goods by prices, which, in equilibrium, represent the marginal  utility people get from \\ntheir consumption, but overall welfare should weigh the qu antity of goods by the average  utility, which is \\ngenerally higher. According to this argument, you can choose to measure output, using GDP, or welfare, \\nusing consumer surplus, but one should not confuse the two.  \\nThis intuition is misleading. First, no par ticular number captures the level of welfare or even the level \\nof real income. How well off are we? It is a concept that only applies in relative terms: Are we better off  \\neconomically  than we were last year, or are we better off than another country? These  are the only types of \\nquestions we can answer. Similarly, real GDP (as opposed to nominal) is also only defined as a relative \\nconcept —that is, we choose a year in which we assume real GDP is equal to nominal GDP, and then create \\nan index of real GDP based  on that . So, it doesn’t make sense to say that the level of welfare is higher than \\nthe level of real GDP.  \\nFurthermore, there is no alternative measure of welfare based on consumer surplus, because the sum of \\nconsumer surpluses good by good is not a measu re of overall welfare . Consumer surplus (defined as the \\ntriangle under a demand function) is an approximation of the amount of money  one would have to give \\na consumer if the price of one good got so high that t hey chose not to buy it at all —or, equivalentl y, if the \\ngood did not exist. It by definition holds everything else constant and answers a well -specified and \\nanswerable question: how much money would you need in order to be as well off as you are with your \\ncurrent income but none of the good in questio n?  For example, how much money wou ld you need in a \\nworld without i Phones to be as well off as you are with your current in come and the ability to buy an \\niPhone for $700? The increment to income to make you as well off as you are now is the consumer surplu s \\nyou get from the ability to buy an i Phone for $700 .   \\nOne cannot add consumer surpluses together good by good to get welfare . How much money would \\nwe have to give you if you could  not buy anything? No amount of money would make you as well off you \\nare no w, since you could  not have any goods.  \\nTo get more intuition, examine the following utility function and the consumer surplus for each good.  \\nLet  𝑈(𝐶,𝐻)=√𝐶+√𝐻 and the budget constraint be: 𝑌=𝑃𝐶𝐶+𝑃𝐻𝐻. \\nMaximizing U subject to the budget constraint gives you  𝐶=𝑃𝐻𝑌\\n𝑃𝐶(𝑃𝐶+𝑃𝐻) 𝐻=𝑃𝐶𝑌\\n𝑃𝐻(𝑃𝐶+𝑃𝐻) . \\nStart off with income of $10 and prices of both goods $1, so C  = 5, H  = 5 and Utility = 2√5.  \\nSpending on C is $5 and spending on H is $5.

How much more money do we have to give you in order \\nfor you to be as happy as you were when you could buy C?  Let’s call the amount of H you would \\nneed H* and the income you would need Y* .  \\nWith C = 0,  𝐻∗=20 and 𝑌∗=$20, and 𝑈=√0+√20=2√5.  \\n \\nThus, you need an additional $10 ($20 -$10) to compensate you for losing C, so you might say the \\nvalue of C is $10 —equal to income itself and double the amount that you were spending on C \\nbefore! You might say that, if C is worth $10 and H is wor th $10  (by symmetry) , then welfare \\nmust be $20 when GDP is $10, but that would be wrong. It would imply that U(5,5) = U(20,20), \\nwhich is obviously untrue . All it implies is that U(5,5) = U(0,20) = U(20,0) .  \\n \\nThus, there is nothing inconsistent with the fac t that the consumer surplus for one good can be \\nextremely large and the fact that the change in real GDP measures the change in welfare, defined \\nin monetary terms.  \\n '),\n",

The price of F falls, and nominal income is \\nunchanged . The change in consumer  surplus from that price change can be read off the demand curve for \\ngood F, as shown below.

HOW CAN CHANGES IN REAL GDP MEASURE CHANGES IN \\nCONSUMER S URPLUS GIVEN THE PARADOX OF  DIAMONDS AND \\nWATER?  \\nSome people use the intuition from the “paradox of diamonds and water” —which explains why diamonds \\nare more expensive than water even though water is essential  to life and hence obviously more valuable — \\nto argue that welfare is much bigger than GDP because many goods (like water) are much more valuable \\nto consumers than what they pay for them. Since nominal GDP is what people pay for the goods they buy, \\nthey arg ue, welfare must be greater than GDP . Another way of stating the argument is that GDP weighs \\nthe quantities of goods by prices, which, in equilibrium, represent the marginal  utility people get from \\ntheir consumption, but overall welfare should weigh the qu antity of goods by the average  utility, which is \\ngenerally higher. According to this argument, you can choose to measure output, using GDP, or welfare, \\nusing consumer surplus, but one should not confuse the two.  \\nThis intuition is misleading. First, no par ticular number captures the level of welfare or even the level \\nof real income. How well off are we? It is a concept that only applies in relative terms: Are we better off'),\n",

These  are the only types of \\nquestions we can answer. Similarly, real GDP (as opposed to nominal) is also only defined as a relative \\nconcept —that is, we choose a year in which we assume real GDP is equal to nominal GDP, and then create \\nan index of real GDP based  on that . So, it doesn’t make sense to say that the level of welfare is higher than \\nthe level of real GDP.  \\nFurthermore, there is no alternative measure of welfare based on consumer surplus, because the sum of \\nconsumer surpluses good by good is not a measu re of overall welfare . Consumer surplus (defined as the \\ntriangle under a demand function) is an approximation of the amount of money  one would have to give \\na consumer if the price of one good got so high that t hey chose not to buy it at all —or, equivalentl y, if the \\ngood did not exist. It by definition holds everything else constant and answers a well -specified and \\nanswerable question: how much money would you need in order to be as well off as you are with your \\ncurrent income but none of the good in questio n?  For example, how much money wou ld you need in a \\nworld without i Phones to be as well off as you are with your current in come and the ability to buy an \\niPhone for $700?

For example, \\nGDP does not include important societal features such as discrimination and crime. In addition, as an \\neconomy -wide concept, GDP does not provide information about the distribution of income, which bears \\nimportantly on the welfare of individuals within an economy.5 Nor does GDP capture features of the \\nenvironment such as climate change and the availability of natur al resources.  \\nMuch of the discussion of GDP and welfare in this paper will focus on a narrower distinction —the \\ndifference between GDP and what we call aggregate  economic  well -being , defined as the consumer \\nwelfare derived from market -based activities and selected non -market -based activities such as services \\nprovided by governments, certain nonprofit institutions, and homeownership.  \\n \\nThe key differences between GDP and aggregate eco nomic well -being are:  \\n \\n1. GDP excludes most home production, and other “non -market” activities such as leisure , even \\nthough most such activity effectively increases the true consumption of households and thus \\nenhances welfare (more discussion of this point be low).  \\n. . .'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': 'documents\\\\GDP.pdf'}, page_content='welfare or even economic well -being, the GDP concept —along with the pieces of GDP available through \\nthe national ac counts —is useful in and of itself and should provide a great deal of information that is \\nclosely related to welfare.  \\nOur finding that changes in real GDP do a reasonable job in capturing changes in economic well -\\nbeing has one important exception. We argue  that the exclusion of non -market activities that bear on \\neconomic well -being merits more attention, particularly given the potential for changes in the importance \\nof such activities over time to change the degree to which changes in GDP capture changes in  well-being.  \\nMoreover, there are several important areas where measurement falls short of the conceptual ideal. \\nFirst, the national accounts may mismeasure the nominal GDP arising from the digital economy and the \\noperation of multinationals corporations. S econd, the deflators used to separate GDP into nominal GDP \\nand real GDP may produce a biased measure of inflation. Our analysis suggests that, for goods and \\nservices that do not change in quality over time, current deflator methods work reasonably well. Bu t, for \\nnew goods and services or goods in services that are changing in quality, current methods may not \\ncapture consumer surplus well. We believe that efforts to improve price measurement in order to measure \\nconsumer welfare should be pursued, as it is cl ear that such a measure would be very useful for')]\n",
